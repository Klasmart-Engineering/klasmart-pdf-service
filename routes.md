# API Documentation

- GET pdf/:pdfFilename/view.html - Example: `https://kidsloop-pdf-service/pdf/some-document.pdf/view.html`. Responds with HTML page for rendering the PDF document. Responsds with content type text/html.
- GET pdf/:pdfFilename/validate - Example: `https://kidsloop-pdf-service/pdf/some-document.pdf/validate`. Attempts to validate the PDF document by individually rendering each page.  Responds with content type application/json - { valid: boolean, pages: number }.
- GET pdf/:pdfFilename/page/:pageNumber  - Example: `https://kidsloop-pdf-service/pdf/some-document.pdf/page/1`. Loads JPEG render of a page of the PDF document, creating a render if not already rendered. Responds with content type image/jpeg.
- GET pdf/:pdfFilename/render-page/:pageNumber - Example: `https://kidsloop-pdf-service/pdf/some-document.pdf/render-page/1`. - **Only available when application running in development mode!** This endpoint is used to test image rendering. Does not attempt to load the image from storage and instead always creates a fresh render of the PDF page. Responds with content type image/jpeg.
- GET pdf/:pdfFilename/prerender - Example: `https://kidsloop-pdf-service/pdf/some-document.pdf/prerender`. Responds with 204 after validating that the PDF is found.  Does not wait for validation to complete before returning. Therefore errors in the prerender process will not be reported to the client, but the PDF should already be validated by the validate function.  This method is not intended to be consumed by a user-facing interface, but rather to be triggered by hooks when files are uploaded to CMS so initial client loads will not be slow.
